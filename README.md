## Usage

As soon as you added the reference to the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AutoFindViews/), a target is added to your project that generates a classes in a `Layout` folder in your project output dir (`obj`) for each one of you `.axml` layout file.

**Warning:** files are generated only during build.

**Warning:** auto-completion can be broken, just reopen your view files that reference your layouts.

## About

The project was made as a build task, and not with a [Single File Generator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb166817.aspx) for easiness of use. Unfortunately, **SFG** can't be distributed as a NuGet package and must be installed on the development environnements manually.
